# Basic HTML Recipe Website

## Overview
This is a simple static website built using basic HTML elements to practice fundamental web development concepts. The site consists of an `index.html` homepage that links to three separate recipe pages, each containing an image, ingredients list, and step-by-step cooking instructions.

## Features
- Uses basic HTML elements such as:
  - `<header>` for the page title
  - `<ul>` for navigation
  - `<ol>` and `<ul>` for ingredients and cooking steps
  - `<a>` (anchor tags) for internal navigation
  - `<img>` for displaying recipe images
- Basic structure with no CSS or JavaScript
- A navigation menu on the homepage linking to recipe pages
- Each recipe page includes:
  - A dish description.
  - An image of the dish.
  - A categorized list of ingredients.
  - Step-by-step cooking instructions.
  - A "Back to Home" link for easy navigation.
