        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bistec Empanizado is a beloved Cuban dish that combines bold flavors with satisfying textures. This dish features thinly sliced beef steak, typically sirloin or top round, marinated in a tangy blend of sour orange juice, garlic, and spices. After soaking up the vibrant flavors, the steak is coated in seasoned breadcrumbs or cracker crumbs and fried until golden and crispy. The result is a crunchy, flavorful crust encasing tender, juicy meat. Traditionally served with white rice, black beans, and sweet plantains, Bistec Empanizado is a staple in Cuban households and restaurants alike.</p>
        <p>Rooted in Spanish and Caribbean culinary influences, this dish reflects Cuba’s rich history of blending European and indigenous flavors. The breading technique, introduced by Spanish colonists, evolved in Cuban kitchens to incorporate the island’s signature citrus-based marinades, creating a unique twist on classic European schnitzels and milanesas. Over time, Bistec Empanizado became a comfort food favorite, enjoyed at family gatherings and special occasions. Whether paired with a squeeze of lime or a side of mojo sauce, this dish continues to be a flavorful symbol of Cuban tradition.</p>

        <h2>How to Make Cuban Bistec Empanizado</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Marinate the Steak:</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the thinly sliced beef steaks in a bowl or zip-top bag.</li>
                <li>Add minced garlic, sour orange juice (or orange/lime mix), salt, black pepper, cumin (if using), onion powder, and olive oil.</li>
                <li>Mix well to coat the steaks evenly. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour (or up to 4 hours for extra flavor).</li>
            </ol>
            
            <li><strong>Prepare the Breading Station:</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>In one shallow bowl, beat the eggs with the milk until well combined.</li>
                <li>In another shallow bowl, mix the breadcrumbs (or crushed crackers) with salt, paprika, and garlic powder.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <li><strong>Bread the Steaks:</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove the marinated steaks from the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature for about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Dip each steak into the egg mixture, making sure it's fully coated.</li>
                <li>Transfer the steak to the breadcrumb mixture, pressing firmly to ensure an even coating on both sides. Shake off any excess.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <li><strong>Fry the Steaks:</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat about ½ inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Once the oil is hot (about 350°F or 175°C), carefully add the breaded steaks, cooking in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding.</li>
                <li>Fry for 3 to 4 minutes per side or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
                <li>Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
