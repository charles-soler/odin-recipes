        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Vaca Frita, which translates to “fried cow,” is a popular Cuban dish featuring tender, marinated beef that's pan-fried until crispy on the edges while remaining juicy inside. The dish is infused with garlic, lime, and onions, giving it a bright and zesty flavor. Unlike Ropa Vieja, which is stewed, Vaca Frita is dry-fried to achieve its signature crispiness.</p>
        <p>This dish has Spanish and Caribbean influences, with the frying technique adding a unique Cuban twist. Often served with white rice, black beans, and fried plantains, Vaca Frita is a simple yet incredibly flavorful meal that highlights the bold, fresh flavors of Cuban cuisine.</p>
